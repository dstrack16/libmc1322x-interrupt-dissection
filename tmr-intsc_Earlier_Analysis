Task 3 Links

Summary
This was a copy paste from a word document I was working with to gather all the links I think were necessary. 
There are links and some things I've notice below

Main source

Include

board.h?

mc1322x.h include
https://github.com/malvira/libmc1322x/blob/master/lib/include/gpio.h

test.h include
<none at the moment>

Notes
tmr-ints.c
•	led is a volatile uint8_t
•	[line 45] gpio_... functions seen in tmr-ints.c is elaborated in gpio.c
•	[line 63 & 86] TMR0_CSCTRL = 0x0040, 0x0040 is the base of the RAM address 
•	[line 49] Once toggle_led() is called, the led is always set to 1 and thus it cannot be turned back on even when off 
o	[line 47] led_off() includes a step which sets led = 0 so the above is wrong
o	[line 46] led_on() also has a redundancy with setting led = 1;
•	[line 59] what is isr? Looks like it toggles the led once via toggle_led() and set some addresses to the base
o	What does the CS in CSCTRL means? Same for SCTRL
•	[line 96] enable_irq() is located in isr.h
•	[line 91] what is with all the set within TMR0_CTRL?
•	[line 98] infinite loop that runs until an interrupt stops it
•	config.h doesn’t seem to have much influence
•	test.h may have some connections as it does include led.h
•	mc1322x.h seems to branch out to other header files, the most notable as of yet are:
o	gpio.h, tmr.h, isr.h and possibly their *.c file parts
